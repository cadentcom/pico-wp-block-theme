The **Pico WP Block Theme** is an open source WordPress block theme optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility.

## What is a WordPress block theme?

A WordPress block theme is a new type of theme that works with the WordPress Block Editor. It allows users to create and customize their websites using a block-based approach, enabling them to modify not only the content but also the layout and structure of their pages. This differs from traditional themes, which often require coding knowledge to make significant layout changes. Block themes are part of the [WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) project](https://fullsiteediting.com/) and are designed to provide a more intuitive and flexible way of designing websites. They are built entirely out of blocks, making the entire design of a website modular and customizable.

## What are the goals of the Pico WP Block Theme project?

Many WordPress themes are slow, bloated and lack essential accessiblility features. We're going to create a new WordPress theme that demonstrates how quickly a WordPress site can load, while being fully accessible.

To test our theme, we'll use Google Lighthouse. Our goal is to score 100 x 4 for both mobile and desktop.

## The theme should include the following elements

- Logo or branding in the upper left corner
- A hierarchical main menu on the header
- No page builders! Gutenberg blocks only
- Support for a hero image
- Featured images for interior pages (optional)
- A footer with a secondary menu.
